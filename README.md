# Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This project develops a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species using petal and sepal measurements.

## 📌 Dataset
The dataset used is the **Iris Flower Dataset**, available on Kaggle:  
[🔗 Download Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)  

It contains:
- **Features:** Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width  
- **Target:** Three species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## 🚀 Objective
- Train a machine learning model to classify Iris species with high accuracy.
- Identify the most significant features influencing classification.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
